    "items": [
      {
        "question": "How many images can I convert at once?",
        "answer": "There's no hard limit; it depends on your device's RAM and CPU. We suggest batches of up to 50 images for smooth performance; if you need hundreds, split them into multiple runs."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does the ZIP change file names?",
        "answer": "No. The ZIP keeps the original names and the order of the batch so you can identify every file easily."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I have to download the ZIP if I only need a few files?",
        "answer": "No, each converted image can be downloaded individually. The ZIP is just a shortcut for sharing or archiving the whole batch."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does conversion use a lot of resources?",
        "answer": "It uses your browser's resources. Close heavy tabs, work in moderate batches, and refresh the page if you notice slowdowns; that prevents crashes."
      },
      {
        "question": "Should I compress images before converting?",
        "answer": "Only if you want even smaller outputs. The converter already produces optimized JPGs while keeping quality, but you can pre-compress AVIF files if needed."
